### Install

Clone the repo, cd into it, and run `npm install`

### Run the dev server

Run `npm start`

### To do:

- Set up asset bundling properly so that `npm run serve` works (currently static files like images aren't being copied over to the `dist` outDir)
- Add MapBox map
- Render food truck locations on the map
- Add tests (maybe e2e/outside-in cypress tests in addition to unit tests)
